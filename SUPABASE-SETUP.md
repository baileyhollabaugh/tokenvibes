# Supabase Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you connect your Token Vibes app to Supabase for database logging.

## Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "Settings" â†’ "API"
3. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://your-project.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

## Step 2: Set Environment Variables in Vercel

### Option A: Through Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click on "Settings" â†’ "Environment Variables"
3. Add these variables:
   - `SUPABASE_URL` = Your project URL from Step 1
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = Your anon key from Step 1
4. Make sure to set them for "Production" environment
5. Click "Save"

### Option B: Through Vercel CLI
```bash
vercel env add SUPABASE_URL
vercel env add SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

## Step 3: Verify Your Database Table

Make sure your `token_creations` table has these columns:
- `id` (bigint, primary key)
- `token_name` (text)
- `token_symbol` (text) 
- `token_quantity` (bigint)
- `token_decima` (bigint) - Note: keeping the typo from your existing schema
- `mint_address` (text)
- `metadata_address` (text)
- `destination_address` (text)
- `destination_token_account` (text)
- `wallet_address` (text)
- `metadata_uri` (text)
- `transaction_signature` (text)
- `created_at` (timestamp)

## Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Deploy your updated code to Vercel
2. Visit your app's `/health/db` endpoint to test database connection
3. Create a test token to verify data is being saved

## Step 5: Check Your Data

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to "Table Editor"
3. Select the `token_creations` table
4. You should see your token creation data!

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Fails
- Double-check your environment variables in Vercel
- Make sure your Supabase project is active
- Verify the table exists and has the correct schema

### Data Not Appearing
- Check the Vercel function logs for errors
- Verify RLS (Row Level Security) policies allow inserts
- Test the `/health/db` endpoint first

### Environment Variables Not Working
- Make sure you set them for the correct environment (Production)
- Redeploy your Vercel project after adding variables
- Check that variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

## What This Integration Does

1. **Logs Token Creation**: Every time someone creates a token, it gets saved to your database
2. **Tracks Transaction Signatures**: After the transaction is confirmed, the signature is updated
3. **Provides Admin Endpoints**: You can view all created tokens via `/api/tokens/all`
4. **Health Monitoring**: Check database status via `/health/db`

Your token creation flow now works like this:
1. User fills out form â†’ Token created on Solana â†’ Data logged to Supabase
2. Transaction gets signed â†’ Signature updated in database
3. You can view all token data in your Supabase dashboard!

## Next Steps

Once this is working, you can:
- Build an admin dashboard to view all tokens
- Add analytics and reporting
- Set up automated notifications
- Create token verification tools

Happy token creating! ðŸš€
